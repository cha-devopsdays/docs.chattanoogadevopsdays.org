## Overview

As an organzing committee, there are a number of roles that we fill in order to make Devopsdays Chattanooga a great event. These roles are split out into committees:

* [Finance][finance] (how we spend)
* [Locals][locals] (how we do the venue + local things)
* [Marketing][marketing] (how we market the event)
* [Registration][registration] (how we handle registration)
* [Speakers][speakers] (how we select speakers)
* [Sponsors][sponsors] (how we partner with sponsors)
* [Swag][swag] (how we get conference swag)
* [Technology][technology] (how we get updates on the Devopsdays website)
* [Volunteers][volunteers] (how we partner with volunteers)

## Expecatations of committee members

### Time

First and foremost, we recognize that all organizers have lives and jobs outside of organizing Devopsdays Chattanooga. That said, we expect our organizers to be present and active when we meet.

Time involvement varies by committee, but we do meet on a regular cadence:

* 1 in-person/virtual meeting per month until the last 2 months leading up to the conference
* 1 in-person/virtual meeting per week during the last 2 months leading up to the conference

For more information about the time involved with each committee, refer to that committee's page.

### Communication

We also expect that our organizers practice frequent communication. We use Slack as our primary channel for internal communication, and email as our primary channel for communicating externally (e.g., with vendors, sponsors and attendees).

The lack of communication can seriously impact the organizing team's ability to succeed when planning the conference. That said, here are a few tips that can help make communicating easier:

* Make sure that you use a ***personal*** email address for both Slack and the email distribution group, this ensures that you won't get locked out of Slack or miss emails if you change jobs
* Check in on Slack ***regularly***--we don't expect that you'll respond to every notification on Slack, but you should be aware of what's going on
* If you're going to miss a meeting, or can't fulfill a role, please let the rest of the organizing team know as early as possible
* If you're having trouble, or need input from the team, let us know--we're here to help and we succeed as a team
