## Overview

Over the last 3 events, we've discovered a number of things that we wish we would have known when we started organizing Devopsdays Chattanooga. The goal of this entire site is to provide guidance and structure to the broader organizing committee, as well as the various subcommittees and roles that emerge as a part of putting on the conference.

### How to use this site

Broadly, this site covers 3 overall topics:

* [People][people-tag]
* [Process][process-tag]
* [Technology][technology-tag]

If you're looking for a people

However, this event tends to be process-heavy with the aim of making Devopsdays Chattanooga happen as smoothly as possible. The bulk of each subcomitttee's processes are in the following 2 locations:

* [The runbooks][runbooks]
* [Conference day][conference-day]

These two sections are generally organized by each subcommittee's function (e.g., Finance, Marketing, etc.), so for any questions that pertain to a specific committee, explore its respective runbook collection.

### Time

First and foremost, we recognize that all organizers have lives and jobs outside of organizing Devopsdays Chattanooga. That said, we expect our organizers to be present and active when we meet.

Time involvement varies by committee, but we do meet on a regular cadence:

* 1 in-person/virtual meeting per month until the last 2 months leading up to the conference (1 hour meetings)
* 1 in-person/virtual meeting per week during the last 2 months leading up to the conference (1 hour meetings)

For more information about the time involved with each committee, refer to that [committee's runbook collection][runbooks].

### Communication

We also expect that our organizers practice frequent communication. We use Slack as our primary channel for internal communication, and email as our primary channel for communicating externally (e.g., with vendors, sponsors and attendees).

The lack of communication can seriously impact the organizing team's ability to succeed when planning the conference. That said, here are a few tips that can help make communicating easier:

* Make sure that you use a ***personal*** email address for both Slack and the email distribution group, this ensures that you won't get locked out of Slack or miss emails if you change jobs
* Check in on Slack ***regularly***--we don't expect that you'll respond to every notification on Slack, but you should be aware of what's going on
* If you're going to miss a meeting, or can't fulfill a role, please let the rest of the organizing team know as early as possible
* If you're having trouble, or need input from the team, let us know--we're here to help and we succeed as a team
