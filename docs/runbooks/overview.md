# Overview

As an organzing committee, there are a number of roles that we fill in order to make Devopsdays Chattanooga a great event. These roles are split out into committees:

* [Finance][finance] (how we spend)
* [Locals][locals] (how we do the venue + local things)
* [Marketing][marketing] (how we market the event)
* [Registration][registration] (how we handle registration)
* [Speakers][speakers] (how we select speakers)
* [Sponsors][sponsors] (how we partner with sponsors)
* [Swag][swag] (how we get conference swag)
* [Technology][technology] (how we get updates on the Devopsdays website)
* [Volunteers][volunteers] (how we partner with volunteers)
