### Event "order of operations"

There's an order of operations that has to happen in sequence in order to _start_ the process for launching an event:

1. An initial organizer communication to determine who will be involved
2. An initial organizer meeting to start divvying up responsibilities
3. Technology committee members set up and configure:
    1. Devopsdays site
    2. Trello board
    3. Google Drive folder
    4. Work with the Devopsdays Core Team to add any new members to the email distribution list & global Slack channel
4. Establish a regular meeting cadence

Once these initial tasks are complete, everything generally flows along with the timeline in the ["Dates & deadlines"][timeline] doc.

:::note

The more that you can frontload tasks and ensure that they're in Trello, the easier it is later in the event planning process.
