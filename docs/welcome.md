## Welcome

Hi there and welcome to the Chattanooga Devopsdays Playbook. This site is a resource that contains nearly everything you need to know about planning the Devopsdays Chattanooga conference.


:::note

If you're a new committee member, you'll want to start off by reviewing our [onboarding][onboarding] doc. This is the best place for you to get to know more about the committee and how we operate.

:::

If you're a returning organizing member, we recommend starting off with the [Runbooks][runbooks]. These are the canonical documents that we use to guide each committee.
