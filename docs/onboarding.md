## Overview

This document describes how we onboard new members to help organize Devopsdays Chattanooga.

##  Getting started

Welcome to the Devopsdays Chattanooga organizing team! We're excited to have you on board. To get started, you'll need to head over to our [Slack][slack] channel. Once you're in Slack, you'll be invited to #organizing-planning, where most of our communication takes place.

First things first, you'll need to provide the following information to Aaron Sachs, who heads up most of our tech needs:

- [ ] A headshot for the devopsdays website
- [ ] Your personal email address
- [ ] Bio (optional)
- [ ] Social links (e.g., Twitter, LinkedIn) (optional)

You'll also want to review the ["Overview"][overview] page under our runbooks and familiarize yourself with the various committees and expectations we have of our organizers.
